    "## 'Advice' regarding what to do next\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on that table and the project requirements, here is a concrete, step-by-step plan for your EDA and data processing. Think of this as a roadmap for your `1_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` and `2_data_processing.ipynb` notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗺️ Your Action Plan: From Raw Data to a Clean Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to transform the raw CSV files into a single, clean \"master dataframe\" that can be fed into your feature engineering functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Part 1: Targeted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "*(`1_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your EDA shouldn't be a random search; it should be a targeted investigation to answer specific questions that will help you build features. Here’s what you're looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Understand the Target Variable (`net_weight`)**\n",
    "First, get a feel for the delivery patterns.\n",
    "* **Action:**\n",
    "    1.  Load `kernel_receivals.csv`.\n",
    "    2.  Convert `date_arrival` to a datetime object.\n",
    "    3.  Aggregate the data to get the total daily `net_weight` for each `rm_id`.\n",
    "* **What to look for (and visualize):**\n",
    "    * **Sparsity:** Plot the daily deliveries for a few high-volume `rm_id`s. Do deliveries happen every day, or are they large but infrequent? This is critical. A model needs to handle many days with zero deliveries.\n",
    "    * **Seasonality:** Are there weekly patterns (e.g., fewer deliveries on weekends)? Or monthly/quarterly patterns? A bar chart of total deliveries by month or day of the week can reveal this.\n",
    "    * **Outliers:** Are there any negative `net_weight` values? Or values that are orders of magnitude larger than the rest? These could be data entry errors that need cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Analyze the Link Between Orders and Receivals (Most Important)**\n",
    "This is where your most powerful predictive signals are.\n",
    "* **Action:**\n",
    "    1.  Merge `kernel_receivals.csv` and `kernel_purchase_orders.csv`.\n",
    "    2.  Calculate the **Delivery Delay**: `delay = actual_date_arrival - expected_delivery_date`. This is your single most important exploratory variable.\n",
    "* **What to look for (and visualize):**\n",
    "    * **Delay Distribution:** Plot a histogram of the `delay` in days. Is it normally distributed around zero? Is there a long tail of very late deliveries? The shape of this distribution tells you how reliable the `delivery_date` is.\n",
    "    * **Segmented Delays:** Does the average delay change based on other categories? Create boxplots of the delay grouped by:\n",
    "        * `supplier_id` (from `receivals`)\n",
    "        * `transporter_name` (from `extended_transportation`)\n",
    "        * `raw_material_format_type` (from `extended_materials`)\n",
    "        If you find that \"Supplier X\" is consistently 5 days late, you've just discovered a hugely valuable feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Part 2: Data Cleaning and Processing**\n",
    "*(`2_data_processing.ipynb`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your EDA findings, you can now build a clean, unified dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Create the `master_df`**\n",
    "* **Action:**\n",
    "    1.  Start with `kernel_receivals`.\n",
    "    2.  **Left join** `kernel_purchase_orders` using `purchase_order_id` and `purchase_order_item_no` as the composite key.\n",
    "    3.  Optionally, left join `extended_materials` (on `rm_id`) and `extended_transportation` (on your composite key) to bring in useful features like `raw_material_format_type` and `transporter_name`.\n",
    "    4.  **Ignore the sparse columns** from `transportation` (e.g., `wood`, `plastic`, `ice`). They won't be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Clean the Data**\n",
    "* **Action:**\n",
    "    * **Data Types:** Convert all date columns (`date_arrival`, `delivery_date`, `created_date_time`) to the `pd.to_datetime` format.\n",
    "    * **Missing Values:** Your `net_weight` fill rate is 99.9%. The easiest and safest approach is to simply **drop the rows** where `net_weight` is missing. For `batch_id` (52.8% filled), treat the missing values as a special category (e.g., fill with \"Unknown\" or -1).\n",
    "    * **Outliers:** Based on your EDA, remove any obvious errors (e.g., negative `net_weight`).\n",
    "    * **Categorical Features:** For columns like `supplier_id`, `transporter_name`, etc., convert them to pandas' `category` dtype. This is more memory-efficient and LightGBM can handle it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Save the Processed Data**\n",
    "* **Action:** Save your clean `master_df` to the `data/3_processed` directory as a Parquet or Feather file. This is much faster to load than a CSV and preserves your data types, so you don't have to repeat the cleaning steps every time you work on your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this clean `master_df`, you are perfectly set up to start implementing the `create_features` and `create_target` functions in your `lgbm_pipeline.py` script. Your data work will then directly feed your modeling pipeline."
